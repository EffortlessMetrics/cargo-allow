# Direct-floor selection evidence

Selection explanations only; the companion JSON owns proof dispositions.
These paths start at each member's selected default/requested features;
they are local activation witnesses, not a complete cross-crate feature graph.

## Original-workspace topology preflight

Original locked-workspace topology contracts only; not direct-floor proof. These tests remain enforced before the product workspace is projected.
